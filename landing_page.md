# About the Book

This book discusses the conventional acceptance testing strategies used by many agile teams today and asks if they still hold up. It first describes generally accepted strategies, their motivations, pitfalls and techniques to maximise success. It talks about how testing influences design and how to avoid the common problem of too many tests and specification overload.

After the description of the "norm", the book discusses why some of these techniques are fundamentally floored and tries to pose some difficult questions.

 * Has acceptance testings techniques become dogma?
 * Can stories really have business "value"? How can we test value?
 * Can we run thousands of acceptance tests quickly?

If you want tips applying conventional acceptance testing strategies, this book can help you get started and avoid common mistakes. If you're interested in what's beyond the convention, this book will help open the door. Inspired by real world frustrations and lean principles, this book questions the de facto agile stance on testing.


**Lean Publishing**

"Publish early. Publish Often. Listen to your readers."

In keeping with lean publishing principles, this is an in-progress subset of the complete book. I hope that readers will debate, ask questions and help steer the direction of the book. If there's no interest, that's great too. Failing fast is always a better than failing slowly.
