# About the Book

Suitable for **developers**, **testers** and **product owners**, this book describes the typical agile testing strategies using test specifications to collaborate with customers. It's about communication and creating testable requirements.

Getting this stuff right means you'll nurture real communication, ubiquity of language and a common understanding of your system. Most importantly though, you'll have a greater chance of **building the right thing**. This book focuses on the approach and practices that in my experience, really can work. It also talks about how testing influences design and how to avoid the common problem of too many tests and specification overload.

**The ESSENTIAL series**

The ESSENTIAL series aims to take an in-depth look at topics focusing on just the fundamentals. Keeping it short enough for the busy developer and presenting well rounded opinions and experience reports, the series aims to deliver something immediately applicable.

**Lean Publishing**

Publish early. Publish Often. Listen to your readers.

In keeping with lean publishing principles, the first publication is a in-progress subset of the complete book. It's aimed at teams new to acceptance testing and defines a typical agile process you can use to incorporate acceptance testing into your projects. It encourages you to use specification by example and subsequent updates expand on this with an example project using the Concordion framework in detail.
