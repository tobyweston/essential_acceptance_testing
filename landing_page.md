# About the Book

Suitable for **developers**, **testers** and **product owners**, this ebook describes common acceptance testing strategies widely used by agile teams today. These techniques focus on formalising specifications and try to encourage collaboration with customers and early discovery.

Getting this stuff right means you'll nurture real communication, ubiquity of language and a common understanding of your system. Most importantly though, you'll have a greater chance of **building the right thing**. This book focuses on the approach and practices that in my experience, really can work. It also talks about how testing influences design and how to avoid the common problem of too many tests and specification overload.

**The ESSENTIAL series**

The ESSENTIAL series aims to take an in-depth look at topics focusing on just the fundamentals. Keeping it short enough for the busy developer and presenting well rounded opinions and experience reports, the series aims to get across the essence or spirit of a given topic.
