## Confidence and trust

Showing the customer running code builds trust. When you can associate running code to individual customer stories during an iteration, it gives confidence that the team can deliver and deliver the right thing. If we keep talking to the business whilst developing the acceptance criteria, we stand a better chance of discovering misunderstanding early and reduce the risk of critical failure.

This confidence and trust doesn't come easy. Teams may have to talk at length about how a test actually proves a feature is working correctly. The customer may also want to refer back to passing tests, perhaps to cross-reference a specific feature.

Running your tests as part of your automated build and structuring the output in line with stories or iterations can help. It also forms a kind of live system documentation. The majority of specification testing frameworks offer strategies for organising output like this.
