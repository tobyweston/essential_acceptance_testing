-# Part 3

Part 3 focuses on the specification testing framework Concordion. Concordion is a Java framework but has been ported to most popular languages including .NET (Concordion.NET). It's emphasis on separation of test specification from implementation makes it an ideal fit for natural language specification favours in techniques such as Behavioural Driven Design (BDD).

 Because of its flexible nature it also offers several benefits over traditional frameworks suchs as FIT and FITnesse.
