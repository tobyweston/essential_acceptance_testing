| 2012-02-22        | Minor grammatical changes to the [Introduction](#introduction) section.                                 |
|                   |                                                                                                         |
|                   | [Process overview](#process-overview) section is no longer prefixed as unfinished. It's still likely to |
|                   | change but it more or less complete. Added to the sample PDF.                                           |
|                   |                                                                                                         |

| 2013-03-04        | Removed examples section, I'm aiming to complete this later and put it back in.                         |
|                   |                                                                                                         |
|                   | Trimmed back what were essentially notes for myself in some sections. These sections now appear with    |
|                   | headings and no content. I'll probably add these in at the point when they're mostly complete and read  |
|                   | OK. Feel free to comment in the mean time on the comments section of the Leanpub page.                  |

|                   | Extended the story delivery lifecycle to include a 'deliver' step. Lots of spelling and grammar tweaks. |

| 2013-06-01        | Added the suggestion to use an hexagonal architecture to the [Alternatives](#alternatives) section.     |
|                   | This introduces a ports and adapters style of testing. It has a slightly simplified example which is    |
|                   | expanded in the new [How design can influence testing](#design) section. This section also includes     |
|                   | code samples taken from the example application available via Github.                                   |

|                   | Reworked [Introduction](#introduction) section and our working definition of the term Acceptance Test.  |
|                   | Pulled out a lot of the asides in this section, we'll find a home for them at a later point.            |

|                   | Various spelling and grammar tweaks.                                                                    |
