# Preface

## The ESSENTIAL series

The ESSENTIAL series aims to take an in-depth look at topics focusing on just the fundamentals. Keeping it short enough for the busy developer and presenting well rounded opinions and experience reports, the series aims to deliver something immediately applicable.

In the spirit of lean publishing, each title starts with a minimum viable publication. This is the smallest in-progress subset of the book that could actually be useful. This is published to get reader feedback straight away. The best way for me to gauge if a title in the ESSENTIAL series is actually an essential read is to share it before it's finished. Readers can then help set the direction as the rest of the book is written.

Look for other titles in the series on Leanpub.

## Lean Publishing

> "Publish early. Publish Often. Listen to your readers."

The first publication of  ESSENTIAL Acceptance Testing is aimed at teams new to acceptance testing and talks about incorporating acceptance testing into your projects. It's a subset of the full book. It describes a typical agile process and encourages specification by example to give you the confidence that what you're building is actually what the customer wants.

It does _not_ yet illustrate the process with an example project or Concordion code examples. This is the plan in subsequent updates.

## About this book

Building software is hard. Building software that actually _does what's required_ is even harder. A huge part of this challenge is understanding what is actually required. Too much gets lost in translation or misunderstood in conversation. This gets even harder if traditional non-face-to-face communication or big up front system design takes place. Getting it right is therefore about getting the communication right. This book is about communication.

Being able to bridge this gap between specification and implementation is essential in getting it right. To this end, typical agile methodologies advocate a testing strategy that includes encoding your requirements as executable tests. Typically, we'll call these _acceptance tests_.

This book shows how to organise your team and code to incorporate acceptance tests, nurture an environment of collaboration around the specification of these tests and communicating the results to your business sponsors. We'll look at a specific Java framework called Concordion as the specification engine and philosophical approaches to your design to make acceptance tests discrete, focused and manageable as the project grows.


## Audience

This book is intended for developers, testers and product owners wanting to find out more about typical agile team's daily practices. In particular, teams wishing to adopt agile testing techniques and acceptance testing as a way to manage and formalise requirements may find this book useful. The book talks about common Scrum-like practices used to better manage development projects.

For teams experienced in using acceptance testing in your project, the book questions the standard practices and discusses some common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Although the principles are illustrated using Java and the Concordion framework, programming skills are not required. .NET developers will still benefit from the overview in [Part 1](#part1), discussion in [Part 2](#part2) and the Concordion examples in [Part 3](#part3) can be directly related to the Concordion.NET.
