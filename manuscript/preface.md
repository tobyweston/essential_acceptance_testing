# Preface

## The ESSENTIAL series

The ESSENTIAL series aims to take an in-depth look at topics focusing on just the fundamentals. Keeping it short enough for the busy developer and presenting well rounded opinions and experience reports, the series aims to deliver something immediately applicable.

In the spirit of lean publishing, each title starts with a minimum viable publication. This is the smallest in-progress subset of the book that could actually be useful. This is published to get reader feedback straight away. The best way for me to gauge if a title in the ESSENTIAL series is actually an essential read is to share it before it's finished. Readers can then help set the direction as the rest of the book is written.

Look for other titles in the series on [Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/u/tobyweston).

## Lean Publishing

> Publish early. Publish Often. Listen to your readers.

In the case of *ESSENTIAL Acceptance Testing*, the first minimum viable publication is aimed at teams new to acceptance testing and talks generally about incorporating acceptance testing into your projects. It describes a typical agile process that encourages specification by example to give you the confidence that what you're building is actually what the customer wants.

It does _not_ yet illustrate the process with an example project or Concordion code examples. This is the plan in subsequent updates though.
