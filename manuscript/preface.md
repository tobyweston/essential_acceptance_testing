# Preface

## The ESSENTIAL series

The ESSENTIAL series aims to take an in-depth look at topics focusing on just the fundamentals. Keeping it short enough for the busy developer and presenting well rounded opinions and experience reports, the series aims to deliver something immediately applicable.

In the spirit of lean publishing, each title starts with a minimum viable publication. This is the smallest in-progress subset of the book that could actually be useful. This is published to get reader feedback straight away. The best way for me to gauge if a title in the ESSENTIAL series is actually an essential read is to share it before it's finished. Readers can then help set the direction as the rest of the book is written.

Look for other titles in the series on Leanpub.

## Lean Publishing

> Publish early. Publish Often. Listen to your readers.

In the case of ESSENTIAL Acceptance Testing, the first publication is aimed at teams new to acceptance testing and talks generally about incorporating acceptance testing into your projects. It's a subset of the full book. It describes a typical agile process and encourages specification by example to give you the confidence that what you're building is actually what the customer wants.

It does _not_ yet illustrate the process with an example project or Concordion code examples. This is the plan in subsequent updates.

## About this book

Building software is hard. Building software that actually _does what's required_ is even harder. A huge part of this challenge is understanding what is actually required. To much gets lost in translation or misunderstood in conversation. This gets even harder if traditional non-verbal communication or big up front system design takes place. Getting it right is therefore about getting the communication right. This book is about communication.

Being able to bridge this gap between specification and implementation is essential in _getting it right_. To this end, typical agile methodologies advocate a testing strategy that includes encoding your requirements as executable tests. Typically, we'll call these _acceptance tests_.

This book shows how to organise your team and code to incorporate acceptance tests, nurture an environment of collaboration around the specification of these tests and communicating the results to your business sponsors. We'll look at a specific Java framework called Concordion as the specification engine and philosophical approaches to your design to make acceptance tests discrete, focused and manageable as the project grows.


## Audience

This book is intended for developers, testers and product owners. Although the principles are illustrated using Java and the Concordion framework, programming skills are not required. Just as programming skills aren't required to specify how a system should behave. It's useful if you have some experience in agile methodologies as the book assumes some familiarity.
