# About this book

Building software is hard. Building software that actually _does what's required_ is even harder. A huge part of this challenge is understanding what is actually required. To much gets lost in translation or misunderstood in conversation. This gets even harder if traditional non-verbal communication or big up front system design takes place. Getting it right is therefore about getting the communication right. This book is about communication.

Being able to bridge this gap between specification and implementation is essential.


# Audience

This book is intended for developers, testers and product owners. Although the principles are illustrated using Java and the Concordion framework, programming skills are not required. Just as programming skills aren't required to specify how a system should behave. It's useful if you have some experience in agile methodologies as the book assumes some familiarity.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks the Leanpub and all the great people I've had the pleasure to work with in the past. None of the ideas in this book are mine, I can only claim to have applied the techniques and formed some opinions of my own. Thanks to David Peterson for the Concordion framework and the Easynet (BSkyB) alumni for developing the ideas.
