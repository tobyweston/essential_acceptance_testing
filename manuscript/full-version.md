# What's in the full version

The full version discusses the conventional acceptance testing strategies used by many agile teams today. In part 1, it describes generally accepted strategies, their motivations, pitfalls and techniques to maximise success. It talks about how testing influences design and how to avoid the common problem of too many tests and specification overload.

If you want tips applying conventional acceptance testing strategies, part 1 can help you get started and avoid common mistakes. The [introduction](#introduction) section from part 1 is included in this sample.

In part 2, the book discusses why some of these techniques are fundamentally floored and tries to pose some difficult questions. Has acceptance testings techniques become dogma? Can stories really have business "value"? How can we test value? Can we run thousands of acceptance tests quickly?

If you're interested in what's beyond the canon, part 2 may get you thinking. Inspired by real world frustrations and lean principles, part 2 questions the de facto agile stance on testing.

###Part 2 - Discussion and alternatives

**Problems acceptance testing tries to fix**

 - Lack of structure and direction

**Problems acceptance testing can cause**

 - Communication crutch
 - Hand off behaviour
 - Technical over exposure
 - Cargo cult
 - Command and control structures
 - Construct validity
 - Artificial constraints
 - Common pitfalls
 - Features hit production that the customer didn’t want
 - Users describe solutions not problems
 - Users can’t tell how the system is supposed to behave
 - Users can’t tell if feature x is already implemented
 - Tests repeat themselves
 - The acceptance test suite takes forever to run
 - Intermittent failures in tests

**Alternatives (post acceptance tests)**

 - Don’t write acceptance tests
 - Don’t specify
 - Measure don’t agree
 - Log don’t specify
