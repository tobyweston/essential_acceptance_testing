### Pick a story

From Amazon's early backlog;

> User should see total prices for their basket.

Perhaps "story" is too grand a title but typically, requirements will start life vague like this. Our first job is to add some specificity. In discussion with the business owner, developers and testers, focus on expanding the description to make any implications, explicit. This helps make scope more concrete.

> As an Amazon customer, when I visit the checkout area, I see the items in my shopping basket along with a total price and delivery cost, so that I know how much I will be spending if I go on to purchase the items.

I find forcing myself to use the phrase "so that" help me think about the context of the story. Why is it needed? What is the user hoping to achieve? I find this can help me tease out additional requirements that would otherwise go inferred.

On the back of the card, we might capture some early thoughts about acceptance criteria, general comments and scope.

- No items in basket
- Discounted items in basket
- Free delivery with items over $10

We're starting to think about example scenarios and their outcome.


A useful way to rephrase a story is in the BDD-style of _given_, _when_, _then_. This can help focus on important aspects but takes practice and commitment to get right. For example, it's all too easy to skip the hard questions. Forcing yourself to answer the questions can tease out additional aspects which may have been missed.

> Given a full shopping basket, when I visit the checkout area then I see the items...


### Agree acceptance criteria

This step is about committing acceptance criteria to some electronic form and agreeing with everyone it expresses the expectations and is in a form that is conducive to turning into an executable artifact. This is where you'd write your HTML document, Wiki page or failing test using your favorite nUnit framework.
