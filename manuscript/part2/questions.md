## How do I manage large numbers of acceptance tests - keeping the testing process fast enough that it does not become a huge burden and the tests relevant and fresh enough?

## How does applying acceptance testing techniques help us focus on reducing complexity in our IT environment?

## When would you not write stories? Acceptance criteria?

Stories can be a necessary ceremony to overcome other system constraints or dysfunction.
