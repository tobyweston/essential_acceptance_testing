# Business value

The idea of _business value_ is integral with the idea of acceptance testing. A user story is supposed to describe business value and an acceptance criteria is supposed to prove that value. But what is _business value_ really?

I'm working on a section talking about what 'business value' actually is. It may go nowhere but I'm curious if it would be of interest to you? The question is: if stories are supposed to have business value, how can we define and measure this "value"? I suspect there's the idea of potential or speculative value as well as real value ($). I'm interested in exploring this and wonder if, as a peer group, we tend to do the former and never actually attempt to measure the success after delivery.


## Iterative vs incremental

In iterative development, it's the iteration that has value and not the story. Assuming iterative deployment and not continuous, the accumulation of several stories won't see production for say between one and two weeks. The batch up of features therefore won't have an opportunity to add value until they're released.

With continuous delivery, where a story is released to production almost immediately, it has the opportunity to add value almost immediately. It also has the added ability to provide feedback early.


## Examples

Some examples of "value" might be

- The introduction of a feature which saves manual work in another department.
- The introduction of a feature that allows reallocation of funds as an investment opportunity. For example, a system that allows an investment bank to reinvest capital.
- The introduction of a feature that attracts new customers to a subscription model.
- The addition of a new product line on an online retail store.
- The addition of advertising revenue opportunities.
