## Communication crutch

The typical process described above encourage communication but it also formalises it. It places check points which are designed to ensure that key conversations take place and agreement is established.

However, it can also encourage the team to focus on these as the only *required* conversations. If developer's find it hard to have conversations with the business, it may be that they'll make one token effort under the umbrella of "agreeing acceptance criteria" and forgo more ad-hoc conversations.



## Hand off behaviour

In agreeing acceptance criteria, the whole team (testers, developers and business) should be engaged and collaborating. With any discreet steps though it can be easy to assign responsibilities to roles and hand off responsibility when you're step is done. I'm not sure if this kind of process really encourages collective responsibility.

For example, one team I worked with directed testing staff to speak with the business to define acceptance criteria and draft acceptance tests. These were then handed off to the development team who would alter the draft tests to fit in with the code structure and go off and implement the feature. When done, it would be demoed with the business but would often bear little resemblance to what they agreed with testers.

The problem here was that each stage was accompanied with a hand off and a loss continuity. The hand off closely followed role divides within the team. Testers would hand off to developers. Developers would hand off to the business. It turns out that developer's didn't like talking to the business and so the process was shoehorned into mimicking the communication structures.

The intention behind having defined steps is around breaking down communication barriers but examples like this show that we can misuse the formalism to reinforce existing barriers.



## Command and control structures

The agree, demo, sign off check points are designed to ensure make sure key things happen during development.
