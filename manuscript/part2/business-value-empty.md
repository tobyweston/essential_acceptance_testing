W> I'm interested in what 'business value' actually is. If stories are supposed to have business value, how can we define and measure this "value"? I suspect there's the idea of _potential_ or _speculative_ value as well as _real_ value (cash).
W>
W> This section will explore these ideas as I'm curious that why, as a peer group, we tend to do speculate value and rarely attempt to actually measure it after delivery.
