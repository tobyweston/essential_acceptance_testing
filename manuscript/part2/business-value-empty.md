W> I'm interested in what 'business value' actually is. If stories are supposed to have business value, how can we define and measure this "value"? I suspect there's the idea of _potential_ or _speculative_ value as well as _real_ value (cash). This section will explore these ideas as I', curious that if, as a peer group, we tend to do the former and rarely attempt to measure the success after delivery.
