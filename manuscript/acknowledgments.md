# Acknowledgments

Thanks the Leanpub and all the great people I've had the pleasure to work with in the past. None of the ideas in this book are mine, I can only claim to have applied the techniques and formed some opinions of my own. Thanks to David Peterson for the Concordion framework and the Easynet (BSkyB) alumni for developing the ideas.
