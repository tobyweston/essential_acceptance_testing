# A Typical Agile Process

> "When is the story done?"

## Agree Acceptance Criteria

Once you've selected a story from the option list (backlog), you can work it up in terms of acceptance criteria. The idea here is to describe the requirements not in terms of a traditional test script (a series of instructions to follow) but as an english description of the business requirements. It's a subtle difference which we'll explore more in [Part 2](#part2).

For example, with a traditional test script, you might describe a user login in terms of steps; 

> John clicks onto the user entry text box, enters his name and password before clicking the login button. The main page should be displayed.

They're geared up for manual testing and offer instructions that a real person can follow.

With more of a _specification_ based approach, you describe just the high level business flow (in plain english) and a person would interpret this into actions. It describes the objectives of the story.

> When a user logs in, the main page is displayed.

>D Specification by example is a way to describe your requirements using realistic examples. Rather than trying to express requirements through abstract statements, you'd typically describe the context in english and follow it with example scenarios which when executed would hold true for a system implementing the requirements correctly.

>D Following the process outlined in this book would naturally lead to a degree of specification by example. Don't get hung up on the term, I see it as just a useful label for the way we might naturally express requirements. If it's useful to think up examples to get your point across, go for it.

>D Balancing enough scenarios to cover functionality without repating yourself is key. When done write, they should form a accessible record of how the system behaves. We'll look at some examples in [Part 2](#part2)
